The steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower. It was routinely used by engineers, mechanics and insurance inspectors. The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines. See image of indicator diagram below (in Types of motor units section)\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 15/100\nQ: Who dates rocks, precisely, within the stratigraphic section?\nA: Geochronologists\n?: Geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition. Magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores. Other scientists perform stable isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 16/100\nQ: Who formulated the idea of clonal selection theory of immunity?\nA: Frank Burnet\n?: The idea of clonal selection theory of immunity was formulated by Frank Burnet in the 1950s\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 17/100\nQ: What is the second most abundant element?\nA: helium\n?: The second most abundant element is oxygen\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 18/100\nQ: what was invented in 1880 that revolutionized warfare?\nA: the machine gun\n?: The machine gun was invented in 1880\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 19/100\nQ: When did Watt finish the development of his improvements to Newcomen's engine?\nA: 1775\n?: The next major step occurred when James Watt developed (1763–1775) an improved version of Newcomen's engine, with a separate condenser. Boulton and Watt's early engines used half as much coal as John Smeaton's improved version of Newcomen's. Newcomen and Watt's early engines were \"atmospheric\". They were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam, instead of the pressure of expanding steam. The engine cylinders had to be large because the only usable force acting on them was due to atmospheric pressure\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 20/100\nQ: What is the largest item from Italy that is part of the sculpture collection?\nA: Chancel Chapel\n?: The largest item from Italy that is part of the sculpture collection is the Chancel Chapel from Santa Chiara Florence dated 1493–1500, designed by Giuliano da Sangallo it is 11.1 metres in height by 5.4 metres square, it includes a grand sculpted tabernacle by Antonio Rossellino and coloured terracotta decoration\n❌\n================================================================================\nWriting evalRWKV3b.json\nQuestion 21/100\nQ: Antibodies are transferred to the gut of the infant through what means?\nA: Breast milk or colostrum\n?: Antibodies are transferred to the gut of the infant through what means?\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 22/100\nQ: Which century was there a program to straighten the Rhine? \nA: 19th Century\n?: \n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 23/100\nQ: Where was the first horse racetrack located?\nA: Pole Mokotowskie\n?: The first horse racetrack was located in the city of Warsaw\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 24/100\nQ: What did the Islamic State proclaim itself in 2014?\nA: a caliphate\n?: The Islamic State proclaimed itself a caliphate, with religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 25/100\nQ: What plants don't need light to make chloroplasts?\nA: Gymnosperms\n?: Plants that do not need light to make chloroplasts include:\n- Flowering plants\n- Grasses\n- Trees\n- Shrubs\n- Vines\n- Herbs\n- Ferns\n- Mosses\n- Algae\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 26/100\nQ: Where was Dyrrachium located?\nA: the Adriatic\n?: Dyrrachium was located in the Adriatic Sea\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 27/100\nQ: What is the expression used to denote a worst case complexity as expressed by time taken?\nA: O(n2)\n?: The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(n log n) time\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 28/100\nQ: How would the capabilities approach achieve it's goal?\nA: through increasing functionings\n?: The capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “capability deprivation”. Unlike neoliberalism, which “defines well-being as utility maximization”, economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself. Its goal is to “wid[en] people’s choices and the level of their achieved well-being” through increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals)\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 29/100\nQ: Within what variable is L constrained according to the space hierarchy theorem?\nA: PSPACE\n?: The space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 30/100\nQ: What are the \"Big Five\" animals in Kenya?\nA: lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant\n?: The \"Big Five\" game animals of Africa, that is the lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant, can be found in Kenya and in the Masai Mara in particular. A significant population of other wild animals, reptiles and birds can be found in the national parks and game reserves in the country. The annual animal migration occurs between June and September with millions of animals taking part, attracting valuable foreign tourism. Two million wildebeest migrate a distance of 2,900 kilometres (1,802 mi) from the Serengeti in neighbouring Tanzania to the Masai Mara in Kenya,\n❌\n================================================================================\nQuestion 31/100\nQ: What is another way of referring to stators?\nA: static discs\n?: A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing.
